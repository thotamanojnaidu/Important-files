Think time pacing

Total transactions in action (12)

Think time for 12*(3) seconds

1 iteration 45 seconds pacing

Total response time for whole scenario 47 seconds

Response time --> 47 secs
Think time --> 36 secs
Pacing --> 45 secs
toatl time for 1 iteration --> 128 secs

1 user --> l28 secs for --> 1 iteration

5000 users --> 128 secs for --> 500 iterations

time duration 15 mins means --> 900 secs

  n= toatl duration/total response time for 1 iteration --> 900/128 ==> 7 iterations
  
			now 5000users will iterate 7 times ==> 5000*7 ==> 35000 transactions(Means 35000 submits)
			
			Throughput for 15mins with 5000Vusers is 35000 transactions
